# training
**1. c# practice code** is a practice file I wrote alongside watching tutorial and stuff. Not every code in the file is 100% like the tutorial, I have added some questionable things I want to try on that too, so it's a bit messy, but my c# journey is really fun so far!
  **2. the JavaScript RPG Starter** is a file where I practice writing a little browser game in JavaScript.
